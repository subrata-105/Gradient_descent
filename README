#Gradient_descent
This is an implementation of the standard gradient descent algorithm in C++ using the armadillo library for performing high speed linear algebra operations in C++.

This is my first algorithm in C++ and I will be coming up with more sophisticated algorithm's implementation in C++ in the future. This is an attempt to learn more about C++ and stay in the world of optimization algorithms and signal processing.
